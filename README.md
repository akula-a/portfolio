c. Description: 
    The purpose of my website is to convey my professional experiences. It shows my projects in different fields and helps
    a user understand my skillset. It's interesting and engaging through the animations and bright color scheme. The target
    audience is potential recruiters and people interested in learning about me professionally.

d. Interactions
- Hover animation on cards/button: hover over cards and buttons
- Scroll animation on about page: scroll down to see images slide in
- Fade in animation on home page: can simply view on home page
- Links to click on for entrepreneurship, web dev, application dev and business: hover over the links and click them
- Hover to view video: Hover over images on the application dev page
- Fill out contact form: go to contact page, fill out form and click submit

e. External libraries: Bootstrap 
    I used Bootstrap because I wanted to learn a new framework and this one has a responsive grid framework. It made layouts much easier
    and I could move easily create complex items like a carousel or jumbotron. It adds a lot of design elements and consistency to my site
    through the use of the grid structure. It also helps my site become more responsive.

f. Iteration from HW7
- Changed the color scheme and fonts to be more bold and professional
- Added in jumbotrons on the fold of each page with background images
- Added in an About and Contact page to make the portfolio more complete

g. Major challenges: What challenges did you experience in implementing your website? (2-4 sentences max)
- One major challenge was learning about Bootstrap and all of the classes and options that were provided through it.
- Another challenge was translating from Figma to my site because what looked good on Figma did not necessarily look good
   on my actual site.
